<p>Algorithmics is the systematic study of the design and analysis of 
algorithms. It is fundamental and one of the oldest fields of computer science. It includes algorithm design
, the art of building a procedure which can solve efficiently a specific problem or a class of problem, algorithmic complexity theory
, the study of estimating the hardness of problems by studying the properties of the algorithm that solves them, or algorithm analysis
, the science of studying the properties of a problem, such as quantifying resources in time and memory space needed by this algorithm to solve this problem.
